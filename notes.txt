Maze Runner:

Player movement:
	# Not needed initially: snap character to grid, only movement allowed is centered in walkable cells. 
	# be able to preemptively turn character, like one block before. Indicate that char is going to turn somehow ( turn signal? xD )

Traps:
	Add arrows periodically shooting horizontally across the maze.
	Add boulder falling vertically down across the maze

Art
	create player sprite
	create player sprite alts for animation
	create wall sprites - straight, T, bend, dead-end
	sprite for dart and boulder


gameplay:
	Navigate the maze, pick up loot and exit the maze and enter the next one.
	mazes increase in difficulty ( Size, traps ) and in loot.
	mazes are timed, and sur-plus time is added to next one.
	loot improve your character short term, and some loot gives currency to improve long term ( Rogue-like )
	

Ideas:
	"green zone" when entering maze, timer starts when exitiing "green zone"
	Some mazes are not timed ( puzzle-like gameplay ) indicate this clearly to player!
	Could levels not be limited to mazes, but to more open maps?
	easter egg where you can somehow exit the maze and navigate in the UI around it (just because?)
